Semantically zoom in and out on text.

Highlight a section of text on a webpage and use `Ctrl` + `Mousewheel` or `Ctrl` + `'='` / `'-'` to zoom in / out. Zooming in adds detail to the highlighted text and zooming out reduces detail. The modified text will fit seemlessly into the surrounding unmodified text.
